A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship, not a great relationship. It takes work to communicate accurately and it takes work to expose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs.

Sadly, in this atmosphere many students are coming to equate learning with memorizing. I am hearing from many researchers and educators that students across the economic spectrum are becoming increasingly unable to grasp the difference between memorizing facts, rules, and procedures and truly understanding the concepts underlying the material. Aside from the bad news for growth mindsets, this also has disturbing implications for our nation. Great contributions to society are born of curiosity and deep understanding. If students no longer recognize and value deep learning, where will the great contributions of the future come from?

What’s gotten lost amid all the advice about how to reduce the stress of modern life is that challenges are what allow us to strive and grow and learn. The parallel on the cellular level is that stress sparks brain growth. Assuming that the stress is not too severe and that the neurons are given time to recover, the connections become stronger and our mental machinery works better. Stress is not a matter of good and bad — it’s a matter of necessity.

When people ask me how much exercise they should do for their brain, I tell them the best advice is to get fit and then continue challenging themselves. The prescription for how to do that will vary from person to person, but the research consistently shows that the more fit you are, the more resilient your brain becomes and the better it functions both cognitively and psychologically. If you get your body in shape, your mind will follow.

The ancient rhythms of activity ingrained in our DNA translate roughly to the varied intensity of walking, jogging, running, and sprinting. In broad strokes, then, I think the best advice is to follow our ancestors’ routine: walk or jog every day, run a couple of times a week, and then go for the kill every now and then by sprinting. Your choices aren’t limited to these modes of aerobic activity, naturally, but I think they’re helpful categories to distinguish between low-intensity (walking), moderate-intensity (jogging), and high-intensity (running) exercise. If you want to make the most of your time and effort, you’ll need a way to accurately judge your level of exertion along these divisions. When I talk about walking, or low-intensity exercise, I’m referring specifically to exercising at 55 to 65 percent of your maximum heart rate. By my definition, moderate intensity falls in the range of 65 to 75 percent, while high intensity is 75 to 90 percent. The upper end of high-intensity exercise is sometimes painful but always powerful territory that has gained a lot of scientific interest recently.

Depending on what sort of shape you’re in, I’d say you should have at least six months of six-days-a-week aerobic activity before mixing in interval training.

Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”

If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.

We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote” and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.

It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.

We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to get married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s birthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind.

Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred push-ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.

Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute—even by just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get there. Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. We try to write a book in a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions.

One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5.

It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money. Instead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your ultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.

Why did evolution decide to outlaw muscle activity during REM sleep? Because by eliminating muscle activity you are prevented from acting out your dream experience. During REM sleep, there is a nonstop barrage of motor commands swirling around the brain, and they underlie the movement-rich experience of dreams.

The gift of split-brain deep NREM sleep is not entirely unique to aquatic mammals. Birds can do it, too. However, there is a somewhat different, though equally life-preserving, reason: it allows them to keep an eye on things, quite literally. When birds are alone, one half of the brain and its corresponding (opposite-side) eye must stay awake, maintaining vigilance to environmental threats. As it does so, the other eye closes, allowing its corresponding half of the brain to sleep.

Throughout developed nations, most adults currently sleep in a monophasic pattern—that is, we try to take a long, single bout of slumber at night, the average duration of which is now less than seven hours. Visit cultures that are untouched by electricity and you often see something rather different. Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Gabra in northern Kenya or the San people in the Kalahari Desert, whose way of life has changed little over the past thousands of years, sleep in a biphasic pattern. Both these groups take a similarly longer sleep period at night (seven to eight hours of time in bed, achieving about seven hours of sleep), followed by a thirty- to sixty-minute nap in the afternoon.

To impress this fact further, I quote one of my research colleagues, Dr. Thomas Roth at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, who once said, “The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without any impairment, expressed as a percent of the population, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.”

Relevant from a prevention standpoint, insufficient sleep during childhood significantly predicts early onset of drug and alcohol use in that same child during their later adolescent years, even when controlling for other high-risk traits, such as anxiety, attention deficits, and parental history of drug use.VI You can now appreciate why the bidirectional, pendulum-like emotional liability caused by sleep deprivation is so concerning, rather than counter-balancing.

In the article, I described the above studies and their relevance, returning time and again to the pandemic of sleep deprivation that was sweeping through the student body. However, rather than lambaste the students for these practices, I pointed a scolding finger directly at the faculty, myself included. I suggested that if we, as teachers, strive to accomplish just that purpose—to teach—then end-loading exams in the final days of the semester was an asinine decision. It forced a behavior in our students—that of short sleeping or pulling all-nighters leading up to the exam—that was in direct opposition to the goals of nurturing young scholarly minds. I argued that logic, backed by scientific fact, must prevail, and that it was long past the time for us to rethink our evaluation methods, their contra-educational impact, and the unhealthy behavior it coerced from our students.

Nedergaard made a second astonishing discovery, which explained why the cerebrospinal fluid is so effective in flushing out metabolic debris at night. The glial cells of the brain were shrinking in size by up to 60 percent during NREM sleep, enlarging the space around the neurons and allowing the cerebrospinal fluid to proficiently clean out the metabolic refuse left by the day’s neural activity. Think of the buildings of a large metropolitan city physically shrinking at night, allowing municipal cleaning crews easy access to pick up garbage strewn in the streets, followed by a good pressure-jet treatment of every nook and cranny. When we wake each morning, our brains can once again function efficiently thanks to this deep cleansing.

Nedergaard’s findings completed the circle of knowledge that our findings had left unanswered. Inadequate sleep and the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease interact in a vicious cycle. Without sufficient sleep, amyloid plaques build up in the brain, especially in deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them. The loss of deep NREM sleep caused by this assault therefore lessens the ability to remove amyloid from the brain at night, resulting in greater amyloid deposition. More amyloid, less deep sleep, less deep sleep, more amyloid, and so on and so forth.

Today’s institutional approach to responsible investment starts from the observation that a range of environmental and social issues are increasingly significant in business and investment terms. Issues such as climate change, water stress, resource scarcity, ageing populations, and human rights in supply chains are shaping markets, consumer preferences and government regulation. Companies need the right governance to align their strategy with these trends and protect their investors’ interests.(Hayat 2014) ESG, in other words, is enhanced investment analysis

To sum up, the social plays at least four different roles in responsible investment: 1 Social issues are a lens with which to view corporate value, by identifying places where corporations or investments improve their financial performance through more effective management of human relations with employees, communities, or other stakeholders. 2 Social factors can be used to define investment mandates and strategies, shaping the investment universe for responsible investors. 3 Social norms (held by particular stakeholder groups, or society at large) create risks and opportunities for investors, for instance by determining levels of consumer or political risk. 4 Social objectives are themselves goals that investors can try to achieve through financial instruments, for instance by targeting socially beneficial activity, avoiding socially harmful investments, or generally taking into account the social consequences as well as expected financial results when making their decisions

In the Northern Hemisphere, the switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity. Should you tabulate millions of daily hospital records, as researchers have done, you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day. Impressively, it works both ways. In the autumn within the Northern Hemisphere, when the clocks move forward and we gain an hour of sleep opportunity time, rates of heart attacks plummet the day after. A similar rise-and-fall relationship can be seen with the number of traffic accidents, proving that the brain, by way of attention lapses and microsleeps, is just as sensitive as the heart to very small perturbations of sleep. Most people think nothing of losing an hour of sleep for a single night, believing it to be trivial and inconsequential. It is anything but.

A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard bedding and clothing. This surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort. Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their unique physiology, gender, and age. But like calorie recommendations, it’s a good target for the average human being. Most of us set ambient house and/or bedroom temperatures higher than are optimal for good sleep and this likely contributes to lower quantity and/or quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.5°C) can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used.

A luxury for many is to draw a hot bath in the evening and soak the body before bedtime. We feel it helps us fall asleep more quickly, which it can, but for the opposite reason most people imagine. You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.

If patients are given tools that can be used at home to track their improving physiological health in response to an exercise plan—such as blood pressure monitors during exercise programs, scales that log body mass index during dieting efforts, or spirometry devices that register respiratory lung capacity during attempted smoking cessation—compliance rates with rehabilitation programs increase. Follow up with those same individuals after a year or even five, and more of them have maintained their positive change in lifestyle and behavior as a consequence.

Don’t lie in bed awake. If you find yourself still awake after staying in bed for more than twenty minutes or if you are starting to feel anxious or worried, get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. The anxiety of not being able to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep.

An intermediate success spiral might start with a goal defined like this: “I will run 57 out of the next 60 days, even if it’s just for two minutes, although I’ll aim to run for twenty minutes. I will set a recurring reminder to run at 5:30pm. I will place a run-tracking notebook by my bed to mark whether I ran that day, and to remind me to do it before bed if I still haven’t. If I become sick enough to call off work, or if I am injured to the point where running would be unhealthy, then I don’t have to run.” A beginning success spiral might look very similar, except with something easier than running, like brushing one’s teeth or reading books.

I want to make it perfectly clear that when you have a premium hand, you want to get action. One of the most costly blunders many amateurs make is to raise huge with their best hands because they are afraid of getting outdrawn. They think “I would rather win a small pot with my A-A than get outdrawn”. While they win the tiny pot almost every time when they raise to 12 big blinds over one or more limpers, they miss out on a huge amount of post-flop value.

This is because the initial pusher should have a strong range and you have to worry about everyone yet to act.

The ultimate objective of solution selling isn’t to gain intellectual support for your solution, but to trigger action. Your recommendation report should convey actionable recommendations, not mere analyses or reassessments of the problem. The guidelines we’ve presented in this chapter will prove useful when you keep this essential point in mind.

That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities

O’Brien adds that playing poker helps to improve understanding of ‘not just your own emotions but those of your opponents, or of somebody else that you interact with’. In order to play your best game of poker you need to strip away the emotion and focus on the facts you have, and work with those. She adds, ‘You cannot think critically, if your emotions are clouding your thinking, because then you’re not led by logic’.

Most investors can’t play this game for the following reasons: They lack patience. They want a big win right now! They don’t possess an edge in the first place. And neither hope nor hubris (common emotions in the world of investing) deliver an edge. They behave inconsistently. Strategic mediocrity requires a consistent game plan. Most people change their investment strategy in response to the ever-changing mood of financial markets.

an edge cannot be obvious an edge is personal – it must suit your temperament an edge cannot be easy to perform, even once it has been identified an edge isn’t something that is commonly found in investment books an edge ultimately becomes redundant over time, so it requires modification or a new one needs to be devised if someone claims to have an edge, then why would they choose to broadcast it? There is no better way to destroy an edge than to share it widely with others.

broad equity-based index fund that charged low fees. I told him that this type of investment had historically delivered an annual return of around 7 to 8 percent (after inflation), but not in a straight line. The strategy would be safer than choosing his own stocks but it did require patience. Given enough time, general index equity funds were great compounding machines.

Can you imagine Farmer McDonald turning his eyes to the sky and thinking, Hmmm, it looks like it won’t rain this week, so I’d better sell up quick before the market for farms takes a hit. Nor would Farmer McDonald check the grain or livestock prices several times a day. Yet this is what people do with respect to the stock market. They are swayed by the changing economic news and the fluctuating prices of their stocks.

Let’s summarise Munger’s simple plan: Spend less than you make. Always be saving something. Put it into a tax-deferred account. Point three acknowledges that your investments will compound at a greater rate when placed in the lowest tax environment possible. For the typical working Australian this is superannuation.

Define where you are now, where you want to get to and how much you regularly need to save and invest in order to get there. Establish a system of regular automatic cash transfers that will add new savings to an established and growing investment pool. Unless you are a stock picking genius, invest in low-cost, broadbased index funds (provided your investment horizon is long). Ignore investment tips from family and friends. Your neighbour, brother-in-law or best friend has no idea what’s going on. Shut down the internal voices of fear and greed. Ignore all economic and financial predictions. Don’t attempt to market-time. Don’t be tempted by the latest investment craze. Don’t trade. Be patient.

Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ— SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.

In fact, this is already starting to happen. One of our community members ranked number one on Amazon for a specific weight loss supplement. Soon, it was featured in every Whole Foods across the country. Shortly after, it was picked up by every grocery chain in America. And that’s the next stage of this cycle—the merging of the online and offline brands, and the acquisition of the small brands by the big brands. Moving forward, the key to fast growth is going very, very “micro.” The more specific an audience you can target, the faster you will grow. The more “niche” your products, the faster you will be able to release products and get to the first million. If you do that, you will be prepared for the next round of opportunities as they open up. As other major brands start to adjust to e-commerce, more distribution will exist for small brands like yours.

Once you’ve thought of a target person and are brainstorming at least three to five products that make up your brand, your next step is to start narrowing down the first product you’ll sell. I call this the “gateway product” because it’s the first in a series of products you’ll eventually sell. I like to ask the question, “What product will make my target customer want to buy more from me in the future?”
